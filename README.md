README TUTORIAL (PARAGRAPH SUMMARY)
I chose to highlight the past twenty-five years of best actress winners. I collected this by transferring information from the wikipedia page of winners to my dataset. I chose this set, while seemingly unrelated to my work, due to my personal interest in the film industry. I find looking back at the history you are also able to analyze historical celebrity trends (Who was popular when ,etc.). It is also interesting to see the career trajectory of majority of winners post-winning. I also added a line to the API that would analyze if the best actress winner came from a best picture winner as well. This trend was not very common, occurring only five times in the past 25 years. The structure is pretty simple as six categories are in the template. Someone else can utilize the information to make a film related device, response form, or something in the similar realm. One of the major challenges I ran into while structuring it was not utilizing spaces, punctuation. I added a lot of spaces and sentence like questions.  While this would work, I researched that this could cause problems down the road. The process besides that was pretty simple and smooth.
